                <p class="about-text">Since the first half of 2022, I have been studying full-stack web development on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">codecacemy.com</a>. For the first little while, my studies were not very intense, but more recently I have started digging in. I have been learning the basics of front-end up till now. Some things I have been learning:</p>

As a Christian, I want to use these skills for Him and the benefit of His kingdom.</p>
